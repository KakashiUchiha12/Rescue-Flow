## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

The Disaster Relief Coordination System can be further enhanced with several future improvements that can increase its functionality, scalability, and security. Below are some potential areas for future development:

---

### üåê Add Multi-User Support for Collaboration During Disaster Response

Currently, the system operates as a single-user application, which limits collaboration during a disaster response. To enhance the coordination among different relief teams, we can implement multi-user support.

**Potential Features:**

- **User Roles**  
  Different roles such as administrators, logistics coordinators, and field agents can be added to manage the system with varying permissions.

- **Real-Time Collaboration**  
  Allow multiple users to input and view data in real-time. This could be crucial during emergencies when time-sensitive decisions are needed.

- **Shared Dashboards**  
  Provide collaborative dashboards where all users can see updated information on inventory, zones, and aid dispatch.

- **User Authentication**  
  Implement login systems to manage multiple users and track activities of each user for accountability.

### üó∫Ô∏è Integrate Real-World Data for Better Zone Management

In the current system, disaster zones are predefined. Integrating real-time, real-world data would allow the system to be more dynamic and adaptive, providing better decision-making support during real-world disaster scenarios.

**Potential Features:**

- **Geo-Location and Mapping**  
  Integrate with geospatial data services (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap) to get real-time data on zone locations, road conditions, and infrastructure.

- **Weather Data Integration**  
  Use live weather data (e.g., from APIs like OpenWeatherMap) to adjust the `weatherFactor` dynamically, improving aid dispatch decisions.

- **Disaster Alerts**  
  Integrate with disaster alert systems to receive real-time updates about ongoing disasters, automatically adjusting zone severity and resource allocation.

- **Crowdsourced Data**  
  Incorporate crowdsourced data to identify unreported disaster zones, areas of high damage, and relief needs.

### üîí Implement Authentication and Authorization for Better Security

As the system might handle sensitive data (e.g., inventory levels, aid distribution), ensuring the security of the system is critical. Implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms will help secure the system against unauthorized access.

**Potential Features:**

- **User Authentication**  
  Implement login systems where users are required to authenticate themselves before accessing the system. This can include username/password pairs or multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  Different users should have different levels of access to the system based on their role. For example, administrators can view and modify all data, while logistics coordinators can only view inventory and zone details.

- **Data Encryption**  
  Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

- **Audit Logs**  
  Implement logging of all user activities (e.g., data additions, aid dispatch) to track and identify any unauthorized access or actions in the system.
