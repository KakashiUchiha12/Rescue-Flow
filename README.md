Disaster Relief Coordination System is a C program that simulates aid dispatch to disaster zones. It manages inventory, tracks zones' severity and weather, and prioritizes aid using a queue system. Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm calculates the shortest route from the aid center, optimizing disaster response.
