🧑‍💻 Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to compute the shortest path from the aid center to each disaster zone. This ensures that aid is dispatched efficiently to the nearest zones, minimizing response time.

📍 Shortest Path Calculation
The printShortestPath() function outputs the shortest path from the aid center to the destination zone. This is important for planning the most efficient aid routes.
